\chapter{Literature Survey}

Droplet impact has been investigated from more than a century and numerous different aspects were studied by
researchers. However, those studies can be classified into three broad categories :- 
\begin{enumerate}
 \item Experimental Phenomenology
 \item Simulation
 \item Theory
\end{enumerate}

There are many studies which are combination of the two or more as well. Such as \cite{Mao1997} has proposed theoretical models supported by the experiments. 
\subsection{Experimental Phenomenology}
With the advent of high speed photography in late 1800s, which made it possible to observe numerous phenomena which were too fast for the human eye.
Having developed the skills of high speed photography, \cite{Worthington1908} captured photographs of droplet impact. Since then various aspects of
droplet impact is being studied. There are now sophisticated digital systems which can record images at a very high frame rate 
(See Fig 2.1) that enable us to capture very fast dynamics which are not visible to human eye.

\cite{Richard2000} observed for impact on highly hydrophobic surface(contact angle $ > 170^o$), droplets fully bounce, they 
do not tend to spread (See Fig 2.2). They behaved just like spring but found there was a limit in elasticity due to the transfer
of the part of kinetic energy into the drop vibrations.

Droplet impact on dry surfaces are quite different when compared to wet surfaces. \cite{Rioboo2001} studied the effect
various flow parameters and surface characteristics on the droplet impact dynamics. They discovered six different outcomes of a droplet impact on 
a dry surface. In Figure 2.3 they explained the deposition as droplet deformation and continuos attachment to the surface while spreading without breakup. When
the droplet impacted with a rough surface a splash initiated in the direction of contact line velocity at the onset of spreading called as prompt splash.
Another kind of splash can be seen above the solid surface at the rim of a corona and generally referred to as corona splash.
Sometimes a breakup can be seen while the droplet is receding after maximum spreading, this is due to the fact while receding the dynamic contact angle decreases and when 
the limiting value is reached some drops are left behind by the receding lamella. It looks beautiful when a droplet rebounds, this particular process occurs only when a
receding phase  precedes. A full rebound occurs when the dynamic contact angle is large and the recending phases is energetic in kinetic energy.

Many scientists have been interested in the droplet impact on hydrophobic surfaces. In one such study \cite{Richard2002} found that the contact time of 
bouncing drop does not depend upon the impact velocity of the drop (See Figure 2.4).

Movement of contact line is a complex phenomena which \cite{Roux2004} studied and found an empirical relationship with wetting velocity
of contact line and the impact velocity of the drop, which was later verified by \cite{Hung2011}
There were a lot of studies on newtonian fluid droplet impact but \cite{Crooks2001} performed some experiments on non-newtonian 
fluids and concluded that the recoil behavior of droplet does not depend on the dynamic surface tension below a critical surfactant
concentration. Here surfactant was added to make the fluid non-newtonian.
\subsection{Simulations}
One of the very first simulation of droplet impact was by \cite{Harlow1967}. They solved the Navier-Stokes equations in cylinderical coordinates in order to
investigate the splash of a drop on a flat plate and deep pool. They used the Marker and Cell {(MAC)} method for interface tracking. The effect of microscopic 
factors such as molecules movement of fluid contact line and surface roughness were also verified by \cite{Gunjal2005} through simulations and experminents. Impact on
inclined surfaces have also received attention in past few years by \cite{Pasandideh1996}, \cite{Kang2000}, \cite{Fukai2000}, \cite{Bussmann1999} and \cite{Sikalo2005}.
These also have been studied by \cite{Lunkad2007} through simulations. \cite{Lunkad2007} applied a Dynamic Contact Angle {(DCA)} model and compared it with Static Contact 
Angle {(SCA)} results, and recommended usi {(DCA)} for numerical simulations for better results.

\subsection{Theory}
There have been many attempts to explain and model some phenomena which occurs during droplet impact such as 
spread of the droplet after impact. These have been investigated by \cite{Madejski1976},\cite{Jones1971},\cite{Chandra1991}, \cite{Scheller1995}, \cite{Bennett1993}, \cite{Pasandideh1996}.
A model was proposed by \cite{Mao1997} for maximum spread as a function of 
 Weber number, Reynolds number, and static contact angle. They also derived a model to predict the rebound by applying conservation of energy, as a function of 
 static contact angle and maximum spread diameter.
Recently a remarkable study by \cite {Liu2015} explained the splashing of droplet on smooth surfaces being due to Kelvin-Helmholtz instability in ultrathin layer of 
air between the droplet and the surface (See Figure 2.6 ).
