\title{Droplet Impact Dynamics}
\author{Palas Kumar Farsoiya}

\date{\today}

\maketitle


\begin{abstract}
 Droplet impingement is very common phenomenon in the world around us. This can be seen in the nature as well as in the industries. It is well known
 that the droplets are formed when there is a free surface motion but it is not easy to predict the complicated dynamics of droplets. Droplet impact 
 on a solid surface is one such phenomena which intrigues physicsts, mathematicians and engineers. For physicsts the interest lies in understanding the solution of Navier-stokes
 equation before and after impact and various intricacies of the boundary conditions on the dry rigid surface,  mathematicians study the asymptotic solution of the governing laws
 of the fluid dynamics and for engineers, droplet impact is of tremendous technolgical importance as its application lies in silicon chip techology, ink jet printing, internal combustion engines, spray painting and coating,
 plasma spraying and crop spraying. This report begins with a review on the droplet impact and a numerical study of droplet impact applying simple contact line and contact angle
 models.
