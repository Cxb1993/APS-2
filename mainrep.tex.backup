\begin{abstract}
 Droplet impingement is a very common phenomenon in the world, natural and man-made around us. 
 Droplets are formed through instabilities such as Rayleigh-Plateau instability, but their interactions usually with other droplets, and their impingement dynamics on a
 rigid wall are complex processes which intrigue physicists, mathematicians and engineers. For physicists the interest lies in understanding the solution of the Navier-stokes
 equation before and after impact and various intricacies of the boundary conditions on dry rigid surfaces. Mathematicians study the asymptotic solution of the governing laws
 of the fluid dynamics while for engineers, droplet impact is of tremendous technological importance as there are various applications e.g. silicon chip technology, ink jet printing,
 internal combustion engines, spray painting and coating, plasma spraying and pesticide spraying on crops. \par This report begins with a short literature review of droplet impact. A detailed summary
of progress made in developing an in-house code capable of modelling two-phase flow is presented accompanied by benchmark results. Experimental results obtained from scientific literature
are then compared with simulations conducted using an open source code Gerris, for droplet impact on super-hydrophobic surfaces. We conclude by defining broad areas that we plan to study.
